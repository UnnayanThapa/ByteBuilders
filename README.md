# Warhawks Project
Role: Team Member, Web Developer
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, RFID

As part of a collaborative team, I contributed to the development of the Warhawks web application for the University of Louisiana at Monroe (ULM). The project aimed to provide a seamless and engaging web experience for ULM students and staff. Key features of the project included multiple HTML pages representing various sections of the application and RFID functionality for student ID management or access control.

## Key Responsibilities:
- Frontend Development: Built and optimized multiple web pages (macbook-air-*.html) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance user engagement and provide an intuitive interface.
- RFID Integration: Developed the rfid.html page to implement RFID-based features, allowing for streamlined student ID or access control systems.
- Backend Development: Implemented server-side logic using Node.js in the server.js file, handling data requests and communications between the client and server.
- Collaboration: Worked closely with a cross-functional team, ensuring efficient feature integration and meeting project deadlines.

## Repository Structure:

## Frontend Assets:
- HTML files for multiple views (macbook-air-*.html).
- css/ directory for styling.
- fonts/ and img/ directories for fonts and images.

## Backend:
- server.js file to handle server-side operations.
- npm for managing project dependencies.

## Development Process:
- Forked the repository from the original project and set up the environment by installing the required dependencies via npm install.
- Used version control (Git) for development, with regular updates and commits.
- Deployed the server locally using Node.js to test functionalities, ensuring smooth integration of frontend and backend components.

## Outcome:
The Warhawks project successfully improved user engagement with ULMâ€™s web system through enhanced interface design and the integration of RFID technology, streamlining campus operations for students and staff.
